## General Information
- The separate chaining class utilizes a dynamic array to store the hash table and implement chaining for collision resolution using a singly linked lists. Chains of key/value pairs are stored in linked list nodes. The following methods are included in this class and a docstring is provided for each method: put(), get(), remove(), contains_keys(), clear(), empty_buckets(), resize_table(), table_load(), get_keys(), find_mode(). Also includes a find_mode function outside of the class. See below for details.
- The open addressing with quadratic probing class utilizes a dynamic array to store the hash table and implements open addressing with quadratic probing for collision resolution. Key/value pairs are stored as objects within the dynamic array. The following methods are included in this class and a docstring is provided for each method: put(), get(), remove(), contains_key(), empty_buckets(), resize_table(), table_load(), get_keys(), __iter__(), and __next__().
